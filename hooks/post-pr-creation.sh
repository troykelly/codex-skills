**PR #${pr_number} CREATED - MANDATORY NEXT STEPS:**

Your work is NOT complete. You MUST now:

1. **Monitor CI** - Run: gh pr checks ${pr_number} --watch
2. **If CI fails** - Fix failures, push, monitor again
3. **If CI passes** - Merge: gh pr merge ${pr_number} --squash --delete-branch
4. **Continue working** - Pick up next issue in scope

**DO NOT stop and give a summary. Continue with CI monitoring NOW.**
